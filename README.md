Collecting useful open source CFD code, and providing compiling instructions

Smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is a computational method used for simulating the mechanics of continuum media, such as solid mechanics and fluid flows. 

SPlisHSPlasH is an open-source library for the physically-based simulation of fluids.
